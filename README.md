# Phaser / ES6 template

This is a project template for [Phaser 3.0](https://phaser.io) games programmed in [ECMAScript 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015).  We use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile ES6 down to ES5.  Builds are executed with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

This template got its start from [Getting Started in Phaser 3 (ES6) â€“ Create a Boomdots game](http://codetuto.com/2018/02/getting-started-phaser-3-es6-create-boomdots-game/).

```
